# whack-a-mole

##Introduction

This is a whack a mole game based on tinyOS and python game. 
In this project, four telosb mote are used as moles, one ppp router is used as controller. 
The game is controlled by a python game, which is used to receive the data from the telosb mote and display the result as a python game.

##Sofeware : Tiny OS

TinyOS is a free and open source software **component-based operating system** and platform targeting **wireless sensor networks (WSNs)**. TinyOS is an *embedded operating system* written in the **nesC programming language** as a set of cooperating tasks and processes. It is intended to be incorporated into smartdust. TinyOS started as a collaboration between the University of California, Berkeley in co-operation with Intel Research and Crossbow Technology, and has since grown to be an international consortium, the TinyOS Alliance.
